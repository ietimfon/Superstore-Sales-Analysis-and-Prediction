# Superstore-Sales-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover key trends, identify growth opportunities, and provide actionable insights. The goal is to deliver accurate sales forecasts, empowering the organization to make data-driven decisions.

### Overview
I analyzed the Superstore dataset to:

- Identify key sales trends and patterns.
- Uncover opportunities for growth and optimization.
- Develop accurate sales forecasts using linear regression.
- Provide actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.

### Project Objectives
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation â€“ Ensured data quality by handling missing values, duplicates, and standardizing formats.
2. Excel Analysis â€“ Summarized sales by region and product using pivot tables.
3. SQL Queries â€“ Filtered, sortedd, and grouped data to extract key insights.
4. Python EDA & Visualization â€“ Explored trends, seasonality, and correlations.
5. Power BI Dashboard â€“ Visualized key metrics for business stakeholders.
6. Sales Forecasting â€“ Used Linear Regression to predict future sales.

### Tools & Technologies Used
- Excel â€“ Data cleaning, pivot tables, and initial summaries.
- PostgreSQL â€“ Data storage and SQL queries.
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn) â€“ EDA, visualization, and forecasting.
- Power BI â€“ Interactive dashboard for business insights.

### Methodology
#### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)
- Standardized date formats for consistency.
- Created pivot tables to summarize sales by:
  - Region (Highest sales in the West).
  - Product (Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier had the highest revenue and profit).

#### 2. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
- Imported the dataset into PostgreSQL.
- Performed queries to filter, sort, and group data.
- Used joins to calculate total revenue by category and region.

#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python - Pandas & Matplotlib)
- Analyzed sales distribution and correlations.
- Visualizations:
  - Monthly Sales Trends (Identified seasonality peaks in Q4).

#### 4. Power BI Dashboard
Built an interactive dashboard with:
- Monthly Sales Trends.
- Top Products by Revenue and profit.
- Regional Performance Metrics.
- Performance by states.
- Performance by segment and category.

#### 5. Sales Forecasting (Linear Regression in Python)
- Used historical sales data to predict future trends.

### Key Insights & Recommendations 
- ðŸ“Œ Top-Performing Region: West had the highest sales; consider targeted marketing here. (WORK IN PROGRESS)
- ðŸ“Œ Best-Selling Category: Technology products yield high profitsâ€”expand inventory.
- ðŸ“Œ Seasonal Trends: Sales peak in Q4 (holiday season)â€”plan promotions accordingly.
- ðŸ“Œ Forecast: Expected 10% revenue growthâ€”align inventory and staffing.

### Deliverables
- âœ… Cleaned Superstore Dataset
- âœ… SQL Queries
- âœ… Python EDA Notebook
- âœ… Power BI Dashboard

### How to Reproduce This Analysis
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook for EDA and forecasting.
2. Import the SQL queries into PostgreSQL.
3. Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard.

### Future Work
ðŸ”¹ Implement time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet).
ðŸ”¹ Analyze customer segmentation for personalized marketing.
ðŸ”¹ Expand dashboard with real-time data integration.
